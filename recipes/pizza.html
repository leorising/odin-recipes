        <p>There are few things in life as great as a hot slice of pizza. 
            Crispy crust, warm melty cheese, and your favorite toppings — 
            it doesn't get much better than that. While you probably have
            your favorite pizza restaurant on speed dial, skip the takeout
            pie and try one of these recipes instead — you won't be disappointed. 
            Whether you're team deep-dish, brick-oven, Detroit-style, or like to
            mix it up with different pizza flavors, we have a recipe that you and your 
            family are sure to love. Scroll through to find our best pizza recipes
            of all time that just might take down your takeout.</p>
